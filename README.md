## 📖 About This Book

Machine Learning and Deep Learning are now core skills in Computer Science, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence education. While universities provide strong **theoretical foundations**, many learners face a critical challenge:

> **They understand the theory but struggle to build real, working models.**

This book is written to **bridge that exact gap**.

Rather than focusing only on formulas or ready-made code, this book teaches **how to think**, **how to decide**, and **how to debug** while building Machine Learning and Deep Learning systems.

It transforms learners from **code followers** into **confident model designers**.
